Certainly! Let’s go through a simple example of deploying a Docker container to Kubernetes, followed by some commonly asked Kubernetes-related interview questions.

---

### Deploying a Docker Container to Kubernetes

In this example, we’ll deploy the Django project (or any other simple application) you containerized in Docker to a Kubernetes cluster.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: To create and manage Docker images.
- **Kubectl**: The Kubernetes command-line tool to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Minikube** (for local development): If you don’t have access to a Kubernetes cluster, Minikube can set up a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine.

#### 2. Building the Docker Image

First, build the Docker image if you haven’t already:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder (with the Dockerfile) and run:
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

This creates an image named `myapp`.

#### 3. Running Minikube (for Local Kubernetes Cluster)

If you’re using Minikube, start your cluster:

```bash
minikube start
```

Once Minikube is up and running, make sure to tell Docker to use Minikube’s Docker daemon so that Minikube has access to your image:

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

#### 4. Creating Kubernetes Deployment and Service Files

To deploy your app, you’ll need a **Deployment** and a **Service** configuration file.

##### `deployment.yaml`

The Deployment will manage the application pods, ensuring the desired number of instances are running.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Number of application instances
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: myapp:latest  # Make sure this matches your Docker image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000  # Port your Django app listens on
```

##### `service.yaml`

The Service exposes your application so it can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80          # Port on the cluster
      targetPort: 8000  # Port on the container
  type: NodePort  # Exposes the service on each Node's IP
```

#### 5. Deploying to Kubernetes

Apply these configurations to the Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

#### 6. Verifying the Deployment

Check the status of your pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see two pods running for `myapp-deployment`.

#### 7. Accessing Your Application

To access your application, find the NodePort that Kubernetes assigned. You can use this command:

```bash
kubectl get service myapp-service
```

This should display the service details, including the NodePort. If you’re using Minikube, you can also access the service by running:

```bash
minikube service myapp-service
```

This command will open the application in your default web browser.

### Basic Kubernetes Interview Questions

Here are some common Kubernetes-related interview questions to help you prepare:

1. **What is Kubernetes? Why is it used?**
   - Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps manage microservices across multiple hosts, provides self-healing, load balancing, and ensures the desired state of applications.

2. **What are Kubernetes Pods?**
   - A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster and can contain one or multiple containers that share the same network and storage.

3. **Explain the difference between a Kubernetes Deployment and a StatefulSet.**
   - **Deployment**: Used for stateless applications; it ensures that the specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
   - **StatefulSet**: Used for stateful applications; it maintains a unique identity and persistent storage for each pod, often required for databases.

4. **What is the role of a Kubernetes Service?**
   - A Kubernetes Service provides a stable IP address and DNS name to a set of pods, allowing applications to discover and communicate with each other. It abstracts the underlying pods and can expose applications to external traffic.

5. **What is a ConfigMap, and how is it used?**
   - A ConfigMap stores configuration data that can be used by Kubernetes applications. It separates configuration data from code, allowing you to change configurations without rebuilding the container image.

6. **How does Kubernetes handle load balancing?**
   - Kubernetes uses Services to provide load balancing across pods. A Service selects a group of pods using a label selector and distributes incoming traffic evenly across these pods.

7. **What is the purpose of a Kubernetes Ingress?**
   - Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster, typically HTTP or HTTPS. It provides a set of rules to route traffic and enables features like SSL termination and virtual hosting.

8. **Explain how Horizontal Pod Autoscaling works in Kubernetes.**
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics. It ensures the application scales up or down in response to traffic or load changes.

9. **What is the purpose of namespaces in Kubernetes?**
   - Namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources among multiple users or teams. They allow you to create virtual clusters within a physical cluster, providing resource isolation and management.

10. **How does Kubernetes handle persistent storage?**
    - Kubernetes uses Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to manage storage. A PV is a piece of storage in the cluster, and a PVC is a request for storage. This mechanism decouples storage from the application, allowing Kubernetes to manage dynamic or static provisioning.

These concepts and practical examples should give you a solid foundation for deploying Dockerized applications to Kubernetes and discussing Kubernetes in your IBM interview. Good luck!
